# 🎓 Data Frame University Clustering Project

## 📌 Overview
This project analyzes and clusters university data using unsupervised learning techniques.  
We apply KMeans, PCA, and t-SNE to visualize and segment universities based on their features.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- scikit-learn

## 📊 Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Standardization of features using `StandardScaler`
- Dimensionality reduction with PCA and t-SNE
- Clustering using KMeans
- Evaluation using silhouette score
- Visualization of clusters in 2D space


## 📁 Dataset
The dataset used includes various university statistics (e.g., ranking, size, tuition fees, etc.).


## 📁 Files
- `DataFrameUniversity.ipynb` → Main analysis notebook
- `dataset.csv` → Dataset used
- `requirements.txt` → Required libraries


## 🚀 How to Run
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter notebook
